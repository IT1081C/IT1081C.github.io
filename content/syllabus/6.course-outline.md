Make up exams will only be offered if a student provides a valid doctorâ€™s note or excused absence. If a makeup exam is offered, it is not guaranteed to be the same exam that other students are given.

The project contains two parts, one using a Linux System and one using a Windows Server system. The final project instructions are available to view at any time but must be completed by the due date specified. A more detailed explanation will be given at the end of the semester when the project is assigned.

You are free to use any resource to help complete the project, excluding the instructor. Think of the project as an open world test. You may use your notes, ask for help from others, or even use the Internet.
