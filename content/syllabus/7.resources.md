## Required Technology

* Virtual machines infrastructure or software such as:
  * The Ohio Cyber Range/CECH Sandbox
  * VMWare Workstation
  * Virtual Box

### Any modern browser

You may use any Modern Browser of your choosing for this course. I will be using Chrome. However, Firefox, and Edge will do just fine.
There is a problem with Sandbox and Chromium-based browsers where you get stuck in a login loop. This can be avoided by using Firefox or an incognito window
